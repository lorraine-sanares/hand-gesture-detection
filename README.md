- Recognize specific hand gestures via webcam.
- Maps gestures to actions (e.g., swipe = switch apps, fist = open Spotify).
- Automates tasks like opening apps, switching windows, or controlling media.

Additional features:
- 3D print body to make it kawaii
- Voice recognition, no need to rely on internet connection

Project inspired by Pewdipie's engineering arc :P
